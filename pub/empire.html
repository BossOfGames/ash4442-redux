        <h1>Revolution & Empire</h1>
        <p>
            In 1853, as Commodore Perry entered Edo's harbor, the Japanese quickly realized how technologically inferior
            they were to the rest of the world. Commodore Perry had a simple and direct message "Agree to trade in peace,
            or suffer the consequences in war." (Gordon 50) Perry's message to Japan didn't carry empty weight. American
            sailors and whalers who traversed the waters near Japan were sometimes incarcerated and treated inhumanely.
            (Duus 11)
        </p>
        <p>
            The trade deals installed by the West put Japan at a disadvantage. The treaties and the economic imbalance caused
            by debasing its gold coins to bring Japan in line with world standards, created sharp inflation. This inflation
            led to protests in many cities. (Gordon 52)

                    In December of 1867, Choshu and Satsuma armies marched to Kyoto, taking control. Emperor Meiji, the latest
                    successor to the throne, declared the start of the "restoration." This bakufu, who were in control, were to
                    be completely abolished. This coup d'état had bloodshed. Samuri from the north were resistant to the new
                    government. The quarrels were stiff, however were dealt with appropriately.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Critical steps were taken, starting in 1868, to transition the government out of Tokugawa policies into
                    Meiji policies. The daimyo domains became politically powerful over its 260-year existence. So, the
                    Meiji leaders crafted careful tactics to abolish all the daimyo domains. These included voluntary
                    surrendering lands to the emperor, solidifying that that all land is owned by him. To keep the key
                    daimyos happy, they were “guaranteed respect and a voice in the new order if they wished. In fact,
                    they were all quickly reappointed as domain governors with handsome salaries.”

        <h2>Meiji Constitution</h2>

        <p>
            As a "gift" to his people, Emperor Meiji drafted a constitution. The document, while based on a western constitution,
            gave the emperor complete control to which he can exercise at any time. While on paper he had only direct administrative
            control over the Prime Minister and Military, he had implicit control over all of government due to his "divine" status (Meiji Constitution)

        <h2>The Fear of Losing Self-Identity</h2>
        <p>
            The Japanese were protective of their identity. The period of isolation created a strong sense of what is
            considered Japanese. Inviting

        <h2>The Transition</h2>
        </p>
        <p>
            As soon all the political opponents were paid off and other domains taken care of, Emperor Meiji
            announced that all the daimyos were abolished and the “prefecture” system would be instated.
        </p>
        <h2>Japanese Societal Structure (REVISED)</h2>
        <p>
            Eliminating the existing status system was a important achievement. The existing Tokugawa social classes
            were completely uprooted. In its place, the Meiji government established the commoner. However, while everyone
            could say they were a commoner on paper, the underlying roles stayed relatively the same.

            However, if one didn’t fit within the four class structures, they were considered outcasts.
            These outcasts were delegated work that was considered lower from society, like burials, executions, and
            the handling of animal carcasses. (Gordon, p.18)

        <h2>The Change in Women</h2>
        <p>In the time period between the Meiji Restoration and The Pacific War, women's role in Japanese society has changed considerably.</p>
        <h4>Women in Politics</h4>
        <p>
            Towards the beginning of the Meiji Restoration, women did not have a place in politics. Originally, the articles
            in <i>Shimin</i> confirmed a bias toward exclusion of women in politics because of their social value. (Berstein 170)
            This assumption by the bureaucrats changed over time as policy was created towards women based on these assumptions:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Family was an essential building block of the national structure.</li>
            <li>Management of the household was increasingly in women's hands.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Previously in Tokugawa Japan, women were predominantly separated by class with samurai women the only ones whom
            been exhorted to be modest, courageous, and frugal. With the modern change, the values were expected of all women
            regardless of status.
        </p>

        <h2>The Ainu Post Tokugawa</h2>
        <p>
            During the Meiji Restoration, Ezochi (where the Ainu were placed) was renamed Hokkaido and transformed into a colony of the state.
            Under this new policy, the Ainu required to be dispossessed of their current land and appropriated new land under
            the Land Regulation Ordinance. They were registered in the system of household registers and were given the designation
            'former native' (<i>khyudojin</i>). (Weiner 30)
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            Our country is proud of the purity of our achient stock, and the long-term preservation of the purity of the
            stock is our nationalism... If interbreeding with Ainu introduces Ainu blood into Japanese it will violate the
            movement to preserve our national essence. (Hiraoka 1918:6)
