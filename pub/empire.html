        <h1>Revolution & Empire</h1>
        <p>
            In 1853, as Commodore Perry entered Edo's harbor, the Japanese quickly realized how technologically inferior
            they were to the rest of the world. Commodore Perry had a simple and direct message "Agree to trade in peace,
            or suffer the consequences in war." <a class="tooltipped" data-position="bottom" data-tooltip="Gordon, Modern History Of Japan. p50.">1</a> Perry's message to Japan didn't carry empty weight. American
            sailors and whalers who traversed the waters near Japan were sometimes incarcerated and treated inhumanely.
            <a class="tooltipped" data-position="bottom" data-tooltip="Duus, Japan's Discovery Of America. p18.">2</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            The trade deals installed by the West put Japan at a disadvantage. The treaties and the economic imbalance caused
            by debasing its gold coins to bring Japan in line with world standards, created sharp inflation. This inflation
            led to protests in many cities.<a class="tooltipped" data-position="bottom" data-tooltip="Gordon, Modern History Of Japan. p52.">3</a>
        </p>
        <h2>The Modern Revolution Begins</h2>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col l8 s12">
                <p>
                    In December of 1867, Choshu and Satsuma armies marched to Kyoto, taking control. Emperor Meiji, the latest
                    successor to the throne, declared the start of the "restoration." This bakufu, who were in control, were to
                    be completely abolished. This coup d'état had bloodshed. Samuri from the north were resistant to the new
                    government. The quarrels were stiff, however were dealt with appropriately.<a class="tooltipped" data-position="bottom" data-tooltip="Gordon, Modern History Of Japan. p59.">4</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Critical steps were taken, starting in 1868, to transition the government out of Tokugawa policies into
                    Meiji policies. The daimyo domains became politically powerful over its 260-year existence. So, the
                    Meiji leaders crafted careful tactics to abolish all the daimyo domains. These included voluntary
                    surrendering lands to the emperor, solidifying that that all land is owned by him. To keep the key
                    daimyos happy, they were “guaranteed respect and a voice in the new order if they wished. In fact,
                    they were all quickly reappointed as domain governors with handsome salaries.”<a class="tooltipped" data-position="bottom" data-tooltip="Gordon, Modern History Of Japan. p62-3.">5</a>

        <h2>Meiji Constitution</h2>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/Politics_Under_Meiji_Constitution_02.svg" style="width: 100%; background: white;">
        <p>
            As a "gift" to his people, Emperor Meiji drafted a constitution. The document, while based on a western constitution,
            gave the emperor complete control to which he can exercise at any time. While on paper he had only direct administrative
            control over the Prime Minister and Military, he had implicit control over all of government due to his "divine" status <a class="tooltipped" data-position="bottom" data-tooltip="Meiji Constitution, p2-3.">6</a>
        </p>
        <h2>The Fear of Losing Self-Identity</h2>
        <p>
            The Japanese were protective of their identity. The period of isolation created a strong sense of what is
            considered Japanese. It was only after opening up their boarders did they realize they can make things foreign
            Japanese. <a class="tooltipped" data-position="bottom" data-tooltip="ASH4442, In Class Discussion, Sep 25.">7</a>
        </p>
        <h2>Japanese Societal Structure (REVISED)</h2>
        <p>
            Eliminating the existing status system was a important achievement. The existing Tokugawa social classes
            were completely uprooted. In its place, the Meiji government established the commoner. However, while everyone
            could say they were a commoner on paper, the underlying roles stayed relatively the same.<a class="tooltipped" data-position="bottom" data-tooltip="Gordon, Modern History Of Japan. p64-5.">8</a>

        <h2>The Change in Women</h2>
        <p>In the time period between the Meiji Restoration and The Pacific War, women's role in Japanese society has changed considerably.</p>
        <h4>Women in Politics</h4>
        <p>
            Towards the beginning of the Meiji Restoration, women did not have a place in politics. Originally, the articles
            in <i>Shimin</i> confirmed a bias toward exclusion of women in politics because of their social value.<a class="tooltipped" data-position="bottom" data-tooltip="Bernstein, Recreating Japanese Women. p170.">9</a></li>
            This assumption by the bureaucrats changed over time as policy was created towards women based on these assumptions:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Family was an essential building block of the national structure.</li>
            <li>Management of the household was increasingly in women's hands.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Previously in Tokugawa Japan, women were predominantly separated by class with samurai women the only ones whom
            been exhorted to be modest, courageous, and frugal. With the modern change, the values were expected of all women
            regardless of status.<a class="tooltipped" data-position="bottom" data-tooltip="Bernstein, Recreating Japanese Women. p171.">10</a></li>
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container red darken-4 white-text" style="padding: 2rem 4rem;">
        <h2>The Ainu Post Tokugawa</h2>
        <p>
            During the Meiji Restoration, Ezochi (where the Ainu were placed) was renamed Hokkaido and transformed into a colony of the state.
            Under this new policy, the Ainu required to be dispossessed of their current land and appropriated new land under
            the Land Regulation Ordinance. They were registered in the system of household registers and were given the designation
            'former native' (<i>khyudojin</i>).<a class="tooltipped" data-position="bottom" data-tooltip="Suzuki, Re-Inventing Japan. p25.">11</a> <a class="tooltipped" data-position="bottom" data-tooltip="Weiner, Japan's Minorities. p30.">12</a>
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            Our country is proud of the purity of our achient stock, and the long-term preservation of the purity of the
            stock is our nationalism... If interbreeding with Ainu introduces Ainu blood into Japanese it will violate the
            movement to preserve our national essence. (Hiraoka 1918:6)
        </blockquote>
    </div>
    <div class="container blue darken-4 white-text" style="padding: 2rem 4rem;">
        <h2>Buraku as The "New" Commoners</h2>
        <p>
            The outcasts of society have now gained a new designation, however their social status was changed. With the
            new government and more open access to travel, it made it easier to organize. (Weiner 64) The buraku were far
            from passive in the process of social change.<a class="tooltipped" data-position="bottom" data-tooltip="Weiner, Japan's Minorities. p65.">13</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            The desire and efforts to change fell flat, however. Most of the new welfare programs brought by the Meiji Restoration
            were pushed to the higher echelons of society.<a class="tooltipped" data-position="bottom" data-tooltip="Garon, Molding Japanese Minds. p34.">14</a> Autonomous political activity began to become difficult after 1905
            due to government intervention by creating groups with the purpose of restricting those with 'dangerous' ideas. <a class="tooltipped" data-position="bottom" data-tooltip="Weiner, Japan's Minorities. p66.">15</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            However, while the moves to quell the groups were successful, the government's actions inadvertently
            created a new group called the Suiheisha in 1924. However, not much will happen over the next few years, for two
            reasons. One, most political movements have a period of excitement in the beginning, then a lull period.<a class="tooltipped" data-position="bottom" data-tooltip="Weiner, Japan's Minorities. p68.">17</a>
            Two, most politics will take a back seat in the 1930s as Japan's expands its empire.
