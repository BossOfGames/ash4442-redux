        <h1>Post-War and Occupation</h1>
        <p>
            Japan under occupation provided a dramatic change, both in the roles of people and in government.
        </p>
        <h2>The MacArthur Constitution</h2>
        <p>
            MacArthur's committee of occupation officials, in the winter of 1946, created a new constitution. The most notable
            changes are as follows:

                        <p>
                            Like the United States constitution, fundamental human rights were established. Including
                            freedoms of speech, assembly, and religion.

                        <p>
                            Downgraded from an absolute monarch, the constitution repositioned the emperor to "symbol of the
                            State and of the unity of hte people."

                        <p>
                            From Article 9: "Aspiring sincerely to an international peace based on justice and order, the Japanese people
                            forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as a
                            mean of settling international disputes.  In order to accomplish the aim of the preceding
                            paragraph, land, sea, and air forces, as well as other war potential, will never be maintained.
                            The right of belligerency of the state will not be recognized."

                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            This has, in recent years, been more lenient as the JSDF (Japanese Self-Defense Force) formed
                            to aid in the protection of the country and UN peacekeeping operations.
