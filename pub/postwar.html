        <h1>Post-War and Occupation</h1>
        <p>
            Japan under occupation provided a dramatic change, both in the roles of people and in government.
        </p>
        <h2>The MacArthur Constitution</h2>
        <p>
            MacArthur's committee of occupation officials, in the winter of 1946, created a new constitution. The most notable
            changes are as follows:

                            Like the United States constitution, fundamental human rights were established. Including
                            freedoms of speech, assembly, and religion.<a class="tooltipped" data-position="bottom" data-tooltip="Japan 1947 Constitution, p2-3.">1</a>

                            Downgraded from an absolute monarch, the constitution repositioned the emperor to "symbol of the

                        <p>
                            From Article 9: "Aspiring sincerely to an international peace based on justice and order, the Japanese people
                            forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as a
                            mean of settling international disputes.  In order to accomplish the aim of the preceding
                            paragraph, land, sea, and air forces, as well as other war potential, will never be maintained.
                            The right of belligerency of the state will not be recognized."<a class="tooltipped" data-position="bottom" data-tooltip="Japan 1947 Constitution, p2.">3</a>

                            This has, in recent years, been more lenient as the JSDF (Japanese Self-Defense Force) formed
                            to aid in the protection of the country and UN peacekeeping operations.<a class="tooltipped" data-position="bottom" data-tooltip="Gordon, Modern History Of Japan. p334.">4</a>

        <h2>The Cold War Politics</h2>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, Japan couldn't escape the affects of the Cold War. This was especially true during the rebuilding process.
            The communist movement in Japan grew strong, which meant MacArthur and the US needed to course correct before things got out of hand.
            To do so, he took the following actions.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Sharply scaled back plans to dissolve the former subsidiaries of the zaibatsu combines.</li>
            <li>Relinquished all claims to war reparations</li>
            <li>Revise new postwar labor laws to outlaw strikes by public employees</li>
            <li>Encouraged the creation of a national police force with the Korean outbreak so the US can redirect troops.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            In addition to the above actions, others were taken, such as the crackdown on the Japanese Communist Party.
            Members of which were ousted from both private and public positions on the grounds their political activities
            were interfering with the occupation. <a class="tooltipped" data-position="bottom" data-tooltip="Gordon, Modern History Of Japan. p237.">5</a>
        </p>
        <h2>The Perception of Americans</h2>
        <p>
            Post-war, Americans had a mixed reception from the Japanese. Ever sine the US-Japan Security Treaty was signed,
            the United States kept (and still keeps today) bases in Japan to protect and contain Japan. This was very controversial
            in Japan. They felt that the presence of the US put the country as a target. <a class="tooltipped" data-position="bottom" data-tooltip="Gordon, Modern History Of Japan. p237-238.">6</a>
        </p>
        <h2>The Landscape Changes on Inclusion</h2>
        <p>
            It is important to note that thanks to America getting directly involved in the reconstruction, sweeping changes
            in the government and structure is finally allowing oppressed groups footing to fight back and change their status.

        <h3>Ainu in Post-War Japan</h3>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col l6 s12">
                <p>
                    Little has changed in post-war Japan for its native group. Most were disadvantaged as they were during pre-war.
                    "Assimilation was still regarded as the only solution."<a class="tooltipped" data-position="bottom" data-tooltip="Weiner, Japan's Minorities. p30.">7</a> However, the uniqueness of their culture
                    became teh subject of Tourism in Hokkaido. So some opportunity existed, but at a result of continuing prejudice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was not until the 1960s when the Ainu challenged and protested the racism towards then. The government started
                    to enact welfare policies for the Ainu, however the policies carried more than welfare. The Ainu were challenging
                    the notion they were a 'dying race' as people started to learn the rituals and arts that represented their culture.<a class="tooltipped" data-position="bottom" data-tooltip="Weiner, Japan's Minorities. p31.">8</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally in 1997, a landmark ruling by the Sapporo District Court classified the Ainu as a indigenous people.
                    Then in the same year, the Ainu Cultural Promotion Act became law. However the laws still excluded them from
                    Japanese citizenship.<a class="tooltipped" data-position="bottom" data-tooltip="Weiner, Japan's Minorities. p31.">9</a>

        <h3>The Burakumin</h3>
        <p>
            Coming to Post-War Japan, Matsumoto Jiichiro, the leader of the Suiheisha met with the former movement's leaders
            to discuss plans on resuming efforts to liberate the buraku. The timing of which was perfect. As discussed in
            the new constitution, there were guarantees for human rights, unlike previously.<a class="tooltipped" data-position="bottom" data-tooltip="Weiner, Japan's Minorities. p69.">10</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            However, the guarantees in the constitution did not mean everyone played along. In October 1951, a magazine published
            a story painting a false picture of the buraku. Kyoto city accepted the responsibility of making conditions unfaborable
            and increased the budget for improvements to ￥45 million. <a class="tooltipped" data-position="bottom" data-tooltip="Weiner, Japan's Minorities. p70.">11</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            In 1969, a ten year plan was established that contained a lot of programs to resolve the problem. These were the goals
            of the policy.<a class="tooltipped" data-position="bottom" data-tooltip="Weiner, Japan's Minorities. p72.">12</a>
        </p>
        <ol style="font-size: 1.5rem;">
            <li>Physical Environment</li>
            <li>Social Welfare & Public Health</li>
            <li>Promotion of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries</li>
            <li>Promotion of Small & Medium-Sized Enterprises</li>
            <li>Employment Protection & Social Security</li>
            <li>Human Rights Protections</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Barring local variations, there were three types of programs.

                            Paid directly to buraku families as a way to ease financial difficulties. For example, a family
