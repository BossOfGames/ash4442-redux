        <h1>A Time With Dramatic but Brief Changes</h1>
        <p>
            It's impossible to talk about Japanese history without remarking on The Pacific War between primarily the United
            States and Japan. While there were relatively few changes between Meiji's Japan and Hirohito's Japan for Japanese,
            there were stark changes on the global stage.

        <h2>A Clash of National Interests</h2>
        <p>
            John Dower remarks that most think The Pacific War was a clash of cultures. However in reality it was a clash
            of national interests. (Dower 33) To realize the reason why Japan proceeded to go to war, you have to explore external pressures.

                            The world economy sat in the trough of The Great Depression. As a result, inflation and trade
                            were issues globally.

        <h2>US Trade Disputes</h2>
        <p>
            In a speech he made on October 5th, 1937, Theodore Roosevelt became increasing worried about both Japan and
            Germany's intentions. To play a passive aggressive approach to influence Japan, the US stopped oil and rubber
            trade between the nations. Now depleted on critical resources to enable their goal to conquer the Pacific,
            they decided to attack the US in retaliation. (Huffman 135) (Pearl Harbor Documents)
