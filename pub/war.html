        <h1>A Time With Dramatic but Brief Changes</h1>
        <p>
            It's impossible to talk about Japanese history without remarking on The Pacific War between primarily the United
            States and Japan. While there were relatively few changes between Meiji's Japan and Hirohito's Japan for Japanese,
            there were stark changes on the global stage.
        </p>
        <h3>Buraku Organization and Leadership Change</h3>
        <p>
            An important side event that will become more important later, Matsumoto Jiichiro, a leader of the Suiheisha
            (which represents the Buraku) won the general election to the
            Diet in 1936. His role will be more important later as they intend to restart the movements for Buraku equality.<a class="tooltipped" data-position="bottom" data-tooltip="Weiner, Japan's Minorities. p68.">1</a>

        <h2>A Clash of National Interests</h2>
        <p>
            John Dower remarks that most think The Pacific War was a clash of cultures. However in reality it was a clash
            of national interests.<a class="tooltipped" data-position="bottom" data-tooltip="Dower, Japan In War & Peace. p33.">2</a>
            To realize the reason why Japan proceeded to go to war, you have to explore external pressures.
        </p>
        <h2>US Trade Disputes</h2>
        <p>
            In a speech he made on October 5th, 1937, Theodore Roosevelt became increasing worried about both Japan and
            Germany's intentions. To play a passive aggressive approach to influence Japan, the US stopped oil and rubber
            trade between the nations. Now depleted on critical resources to enable their goal to conquer the Pacific,
            they decided to attack the US in retaliation. <a class="tooltipped" data-position="bottom" data-tooltip="Huffman, Modern Japan. p135.">3</a> <a class="tooltipped" data-position="bottom" data-tooltip="Pearl Harbor Documents, p106-7.">4</a>
        </p>
        <h2>The Perception of Both Sides</h2>
        <p>
            Japan and the United States used propaganda to great effect during the war.

        <h2>Women in The Workplace</h2>

                <p>
                    Japan had a workforce problem. As men were being moved towards military service, that left their jobs unfilled.
                    Initially, the Welfare Ministry was not keen to having women in the workplace citing the "consideration of the
                    family system."<a class="tooltipped" data-position="bottom" data-tooltip="Gordon, Modern History Of Japan. p213.">9</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    By late 1943 however, they recognized they needed to "simultaneously mobilize Japanese women while giving rise
                    to their special qualities associated with teh household."<a class="tooltipped" data-position="bottom" data-tooltip="Gordon, Modern History Of Japan. p213.">10</a> As a result, unmarried, able working
                    women joined the workforce.<a class="tooltipped" data-position="bottom" data-tooltip="Gordon, Modern History Of Japan. p213.">11</a>

        <h2>Truman and The End</h2>
        <p>
            When President Truman succeeded the late Franklin Roosevelt in April 1945, the bombing campaign on Honshu had
            begun. Seeking to end the war as quickly as possible, when hearing of the success of the Manhattan Project, he
            jumped on the opportunity to use the new weapon as quickly as possible.<a class="tooltipped" data-position="bottom" data-tooltip="ASH4442, In Class Discussion, Oct. 30.">12</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Shortly after the attacks, Japan formally surrendered to the United States. While most in the military accepted defeat,
            it took until the 90s for them to accept that Japan was defeated.<a class="tooltipped" data-position="bottom" data-tooltip="ASH4442, In Class Discussion, Oct. 30.">13</a>
