        <h1>A Time With Dramatic but Brief Changes</h1>
        <p>
            It's impossible to talk about Japanese history without remarking on The Pacific War between primarily the United
            States and Japan. While there were relatively few changes between Meiji's Japan and Hirohito's Japan for Japanese,
            there were stark changes on the global stage.
        </p>
        <h2>A Clash of National Interests</h2>
        <p>
            John Dower remarks that most think The Pacific War was a clash of cultures. However in reality it was a clash
            of national interests. (Dower 33) To realize the reason why Japan proceeded to go to war, you have to explore external pressures.
        </p>
        <h2>US Trade Disputes</h2>
        <p>
            In a speech he made on October 5th, 1937, Theodore Roosevelt became increasing worried about both Japan and
            Germany's intentions. To play a passive aggressive approach to influence Japan, the US stopped oil and rubber
            trade between the nations. Now depleted on critical resources to enable their goal to conquer the Pacific,
            they decided to attack the US in retaliation. (Huffman 135) (Pearl Harbor Documents)
        </p>
        <h2>The Perception of Both Sides</h2>
        <p>
            Japan and the United States used propaganda to great effect during the war.

                            <b>Propaganda:</b> The Americans would take no survivors and would grant no civil liberties
                            to their captors.

                            and were a source of information for the Ally powers.

                            <b>Propaganda:</b> Americans to be ruthless thanks to the The Rape of Nanking in 1937 (Chang) and
                            the country was "the hundred million as a shattered jewel." (Dower 102)

                            <b>Reality:</b> Everyone on the home front had mixed opinions. Towards the end, the Japanese
                            people were giving up in their minds, however the government had strong rhetoric to suggest otherwise. (Dower 102)

        <h2>Women in The Workplace</h2>

                <p>
                    Japan had a workforce problem. As men were being moved towards military service, that left their jobs unfilled.
                    Initially, the Welfare Ministry was not keen to having women in the workplace citing the "consideration of the
                    family system."
                </p>
                <p>
                    By late 1943 however, they recognized they needed to "simultaneously mobilize Japanese women while giving rise
                    to their special qualities associated with teh household." (Gordon 213) As a result, unmarried, able working
                    women joined the workforce.

        <h2>Truman and The End</h2>
        <p>
            When President Truman succeeded the late Franklin Roosevelt in April 1945, the bombing campaign on Honshu had
            begun. Seeking to end the war as quickly as possible, when hearing of the success of the Manhattan Project, he
            jumped on the opportunity to use the new weapon as quickly as possible. (ICD)
        </p>
        <p>
            Shortly after the attacks, Japan formally surrendered to the United States. While most in the military accepted defeat,
            it took until the 90s for them to accept that Japan was defeated (ICD).
